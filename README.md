# claim_fraud_detect
Background

Fraud in public health insurance schemes erodes trust and wastes $300B annually worldwide (WHO, 2022). In LMICs, weak auditing systems allow systemic overbilling and phantom claims.

Solution

An AI-powered anomaly detection system using Isolation Forest and graph analysis to identify suspicious billing patterns in claims data. Flags high-risk providers for audit and recovers lost funds.

Scientific Basis

Models are informed by OECD’s digital anti-fraud guidelines (OECD, 2019) and studies showing machine learning improves detection rates vs. manual audits (de Carvalho et al., 2020).

Logic Model

Input: Claims database

Intervention: AI anomaly engine

Output: List of high-risk providers	

Outcome: Audit targets identified

Impact: Recovered funds reinvested in primary care
